### Asp.NET API Scaffold: [Pellerex.com](https://pellerex.com/ "Pellerex.com")
This scaffold is used to accelerate development of AI powered APIs for Pellerex AI platform.

You should use this scaffold if you are a data scientist building AI models to be deployed using [ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet "ML.NET") on Pellerex Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) infrastructure.

It supports the below features, so you only focus on building your models instead of the engineering around it.

- Solid API structure to build APIs using [Asp.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet "Asp.NET")
- [Docker file](https://www.docker.com/ "Docker file") to container your Asp.NET API and test it prior to deployment
- Tiered project strucure to give your API clear seperation of concerns
- [CORS](https://pellerex.com/blog/asp-net-5-cors "CORS") configuration
- Response compression and caching
- Health checks
- API [versioning](https://pellerex.com/blog/asp-net-core-web-api-versioning "versioning")
- Request payload [validation](https://pellerex.com/blog/asp-net-5-request-validation-with-fluent-validation "validation")
- [Configuration management](https://pellerex.com/blog/asp-net-5-web-api-configuration-management "Configuration management")
- [Secret management](https://pellerex.com/blog/asp-net-5-web-api-secret-management "Secret management")
- Central [exception handling](https://pellerex.com/blog/asp-net-5-global-exception-handling "exception handling")
- [Deployment pipeline](https://pellerex.com/blog/kubernetes-with-aspnet-react-and-azure-devops "Deployment pipeline") to Azure

This scaffold comes with an already functionining sample functionality around Language Processing using [BERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model) model, as it might be easier to copy and paste your projects into an already functioning solution, as opposed to making it work from scratch.

Pellerex AI is a modern Machine learning as a Service (MLaaS) platform which enables data scientists, engineers and companies who develop AI models to run, share, demo and monetise their live models using Pellerex infrastructure.

Pellerex provides your teams with the below capabilities out of the box
- [Profiles](https://pellerex.com/contributors "Profile") for data scientists, engineers and companies to demo their AI models live
- Dedicated [pages](https://pellerex.com/models "pages") to show case your live models
- Enabling data scientists to monetise their work using subscription plans
- Enabling your clients to request a change to your models or talk to you directly regarding those changes
- Fully automated CI/CD pipelines to build and deploy your models and APIs, which will make it available to your clients within a few minutes
- Versioning your models to provide different flavours of your models to your clients
- Public/Private endponts for those clients who want exclusive access to your models in case they have provided confidential data to train the models

Pellerex AI is agnostic of any programming stack, and you can run your AI models regardless of how it has been built, as long as you can containerise your application, and expose them in the form of API endpoints.
